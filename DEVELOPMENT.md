# Week 0
## In Progress
  - Understand how genetic algorithm works
  - Find a NN library that plays nicely with oFx
## Completed
  - Download OpenNN
  - Compile OpenNN
  - Test OpenNN library.
  - Download and setup ofSnake, which will be used as my snake plotform
  - Figuring out how to implement OpenNN with snake game
     - How to import .lib?
     - OpenNN has too little support and did not want to play nice with a vector a NN. As such, will switch to a different NN + library
   - Evaluate information provided by the snake game
   - OpenNN does not compile, removed
   - Download and compile tiny-dnn (better supported and documented)
     - Fixed naming and import conflicts
